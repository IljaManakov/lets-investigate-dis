Riddle me this! üêç

<split even gap="1">

```python
>>>  a = {}
>>>  a = a[0] = {}
>>>  print(a)
 ```

```python
>>>  b = {}
>>>  b[0] = b = {}
>>>  print(b)
```

Let's investigate `dis`!

---

`from dis import dis`

---

```python
>>>  dis("""  
...    a = a[0] = {}  
...  """)

2     0 BUILD_MAP                0
	  2 DUP_TOP
	  4 STORE_NAME               0 (a)
	  6 LOAD_NAME                0 (a)
	  8 LOAD_CONST               0 (0)
	 10 STORE_SUBSCR
	 12 LOAD_CONST               1 (None)
	 14 RETURN_VALUE
```

 \*the [`dis` documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#python-bytecode-instructions) has more info on opcodes.
 
 \*\* `DUP_TOP` was replaced by `COPY` since 3.11
